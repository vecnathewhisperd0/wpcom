# Codespaces for WordPress VIP 

The provided `devcontainer.json` file is configured to create a Codespaces development environment that is as identical as possible to a VIP Platform environment. 

Read our documentation to learn how to get started and [work with Codespaces for WordPress VIP applications](https://docs.wpvip.com/local-development/developing-with-github-codespaces/).

Refer to [GitHub's documentation for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) to learn more about Codespaces in general.

## Quick Start

From within the GitHub interface for a repository with the `devcontainer.json` file:

1. Select the button labeled "**<> Code**".
2. Select the tab labeled "**Codespaces**".
3. Select the button labeled "**Create codespace**". A displayed output log in a new browser tab will report progress on the creation of the new codespace (first-time creation might take a few minutes). 

## Prerequisites

- Use of Codespaces within the wpcomvip GitHub organization is available as a part of our Enhanced and Premier packages. Qualifying customers must create a [VIP Support request](https://wordpressvip.zendesk.com/) for the Codespaces feature to be enabled for their GitHub user account.
- To work with Codespaces outside of the wpcomvip organization, customers can copy the [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-skeleton/raw/5060ee2506c7baca258cd10f708a335162ab4937/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file to their own GitHub repository.
- A user must have a GitHub user role with Write access within the repository where Codespaces is used.
